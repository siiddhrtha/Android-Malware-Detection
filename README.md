# Android-Malware-Detection
Ensemble Approach to detect the android malware.
The ransomware threat is no longer limited to personal computers; it is gradually growing to include smartphones. For monetary gain, the attackers target smartphone devices to steal personal information from consumers. Existing methods concentrate on collecting static or dynamic data from mobile apps and using machine learning algorithms to construct mobile malware, detection models. A significant number of static or dynamic features may be extracted. As a result, the data has a lot of different aspects. In this project, combining six well-known classification models, we have used the ensemble learning meta-classifier for stacking using cross-validation to classify the malware. The study finds that the stacking ensemble approach performs better than any single model on average classification performance.
